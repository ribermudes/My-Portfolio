      <h2>A brief introduction...</h2>
      <p>If you had told me a few years ago that I would have switched to a career in tech, I would have thought you were totally bonkers. I was working at a non-profit whose primary mission is using tech for social good, it was there that I learned more about the impact of technology, and where I was encouraged to explore new paths. While I was given a lot of encouragement, I still lacked the skills I would need to change careers. So, I quit my job, packed my bags and enrolled in a coding bootcamp.</p>

        <p>I chose the front-end track at my coding program because in addition to being passionate about user experiences, Iâ€™ve also loved design and art for as long as I can remember. Designing and building modern, visually compelling interfaces became my passion. </p>
